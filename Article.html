   <H1> All about Camels</H1>
   <p> I promise im not writing all about camels just because i'm a Gaalje'el loooool</p>
<p>Camels are mammals with long legs, a big-lipped snout and a humped back. There are <br>two types of camels: dromedary camels, which have one hump, and Bactrian camels, which<br> have two humps. Camels' humps consist of stored fat, which they can metabolize when <br> food and water is scarce.</p>
<h1>Interesting Facts about Camels:</H1>
<ul>
    <li>They can go for weeks without Drinking Water.</li>
    <li>They store Fat in parts of their bodies known as humps.</li>
    <li>They can live for about 40 years.</li>
    <li>Humps act as heat regulators for Camels.</li>
    <li>Camel Milk is among the healthiest Milk in the world.</li>
    <li>There are two types of camels: Dromedary and Bactrian.</li>
    <li>Camels have thick lips.</li>
    <li>Camels can sit comfortably on the Hot sand.</li>
    <li>The gestation period of camels is 14 months.</li>
    <li>Camels are relatively fast in their movement.</li>

 <p>A fundamental difference between a camel and a dromedary is that they <br> originate from different places. Specifically, camels are native to central Asia <br> and, in contrast, dromedaries come from the Arabian Peninsula.<br>
    
    The origins of an animal are reflected in its physical features as a result of <br> adaption to the environment and thus evolution. For example <br></p>

    <ol>
        <li>Dromedaries are more prepared to withstand high temperatures compared <br>to camels. We are referring to situations that exceed 50 degrees.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, Camels have evolved to withstand long periods of cold in the <br> winter. </li>
    </ol>
<h1>Which is bigger, a camel or a dromedary</h1>
<p>Dromedaries are also known as "Arabian camels" - and they are taller than camels. This is because their legs are elongated, which distances it further from the heat emitted by the ground. While a dromedary can reach up to 2 meters - 6'6'' tall -, camels do not usually exceed a meter and a half - 4'11''.

    This is particularly interesting, because this does not apply to weight. Camels are usually heavier than dromedaries.
    
    The camel is less resilient, both on long journeys as well as when going several days without eating or drinking. Instead, it is better adapted to climbing mountainous and snowy terrain.</p>

    <p>In conclusion Camel lovers are a great tribe, our women are beautiful <br> and our men who even cares about them loool. ALSO I AM NOT <br>A TRIABILIST JUST VERY PASSIONATE ABOUT CAMELS LOL</p>
