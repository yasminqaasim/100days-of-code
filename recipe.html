    Easiest receipe to follow, <br> all you need to is follow these simple steps and you'll have yourself a delightful midnight snack <br> or you could have this on a cheeky cheat day (promise i won't tell!)
</H3>
<H3>Ingredients</H3>
<ul>
    <li>225g of Softened butter</li>
    <li>225g golden caster sugar</li>
    <li>4 large eggs </li>
    <li>Â½ lemon, zested</li>
    <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
    <li>225g self-raising flour</li>
    <li>splash of milk</li>
    <li>Optional fillings of lemon curd, jam,<br>lightly whipped cream</li>
    <li>icing sugar for dusting</li></ul>
    <p>you can also serve this with a nice Hot cup of tea!</p>

    <H3>Method</H3>
<ol>
    <li>Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4, butter <br>and line the base of two 20cm spring-form cake tins with baking parchment.</li>
    <li>Using an electric whisk beat the butter and sugar together until pale and fluffy.<br> Crack the eggs in one at a time and whisk well, scraping down the sides of the bowl after each addition.<br> Add the lemon zest, vanilla, flour, milk and a pinch of salt. <br>Whisk until just combined then divide the mixture between the two tins.</li>
    <li>Bake in the centre of the oven for 25-30 mins until a skewer inserted into the middle of each cake comes out clean. <br>After 10 mins remove the cakes from their tins and leave to cool completely on a wire rack. <br>Fill how you like. My personal favourite is a good dollop of lemon curd and some fresh cream, then dust the top with icing sugar. Will keep for 3 days.</li>
